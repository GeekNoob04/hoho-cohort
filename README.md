# Hono Cohort 🚀

This project is a lightweight web application built with the Hono web framework, designed for deployment on Cloudflare Workers. It provides a basic foundation for building serverless applications, including route handling and authentication middleware. It leverages Cloudflare Workers for serverless deployment and offers a streamlined development experience with TypeScript.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Hono Framework**: Utilizes the Hono framework for fast and simple web development.
- **Authentication Middleware**: Includes middleware to secure routes by checking for an "Authorization" header.
- **Cloudflare Workers Deployment**: Configured for easy deployment to Cloudflare Workers using Wrangler.
- **TypeScript Support**: Written in TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience.
- **ES Module Support**: Uses ES modules for modern JavaScript development.
- **Cloudflare Bindings**: Supports bindings for Cloudflare services like KV, R2, D1, and AI (commented out in `wrangler.jsonc`, but ready for configuration).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**:
    - [Hono](https://hono.dev/): A small, simple, and ultra-fast web framework for Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, Node.js, and others.
    - TypeScript
- **Deployment**:
    - [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/): A serverless execution environment.
    - [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/): The Cloudflare Workers CLI.
- **Build Tools**:
    - npm
- **Configuration**:
    - `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration.
    - `wrangler.jsonc`: Cloudflare Workers configuration.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=16.0.0)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (>=8.0.0) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/): Cloudflare Workers CLI (install globally: `npm install -g wrangler`)
- Cloudflare account

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

### Running Locally

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```

    This will start the Wrangler development server, which simulates the Cloudflare Workers environment locally.

2.  **Authenticate with Cloudflare:**

    If you haven't already, authenticate with Cloudflare using Wrangler:

    ```bash
    wrangler login
    ```

## 💻 Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the application in your browser.

-   **Root Route (`/`)**: Access the root route to see the "Hello Hono!" message.  Make sure to include the `Authorization` header in your request.

    Example using `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>" http://localhost:8787/?param=test
    ```

    Replace `<your_token>` with a dummy token for testing purposes. The `param=test` is optional and demonstrates query parameter usage.
